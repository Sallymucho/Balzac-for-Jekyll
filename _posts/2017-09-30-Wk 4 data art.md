Art against information is a curated article of data inspired art pieces. 
Each piece had a deep relation to the art, and each aspect of the art piece was generated with purpose and numbers to back it up. 
I found it interesting that these data inspired art structures took form in both two and three dimensions.
Each artist began “with a notion of data from empirical science, as a set of measurements from the flux of the real”, and turned these specific measurements into something not so clear cut as hard numbers/ data. 
In a field that is so dependent on everything being in order and correct, its interesting that many of these artist created something that feels completely random.
I think the major part of these projects is the cool factor. Some art pieces,
like the first one in the article by Alex Draglescu offers less insight onto the actual data, while creating an actual physical form of this data. 
It was interesting to see how the spam sculpture was “vaguely menacing”. 
Some of the others really do not inform you as a viewer of the art of the data. 
Those feel stronger as art pieces, for they can be read because I can see both the art and the actual numbers behind it.
Borevitz and Salavon’s text cloud is a clear example of a balance I found interesting. 
They make sense of a data set in an extremely clear visual map.
