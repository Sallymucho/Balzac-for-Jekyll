Asad and I have decided to focus on preexisting data sets like that of Hillary Clinton's emails.
Together we will dig through and collect any data that pertains to parties and events. We are searching for the words birthday, party, and festivities.
With the data collected, together we will create a Facebook bot that can offer party advice based on this collected data.
