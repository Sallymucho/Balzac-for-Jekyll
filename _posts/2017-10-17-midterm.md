Hillary Clinton’s Party Planning Service
The idea of Hillary Clinton’s party service came to us by means of both our wishes to tell a narrative though data.  At first we hoped to make a cookbook basing our recipes on Hillary’s references to food, but this task ended up being way more difficult as first perceived. We didn't know what we were searching for. Our key words were not effective for we were playing a guessing game of food and drinks. We then decided it might be fun to work off the idea of political parties and birthday parties instead of food. We wanted to tell a story based on given data sets, to animate Hillary and have to have her give advice in a cheeky fashion. We used search terms like “gift”, “birthday”, “party” and “celebration” to compile all the advice we could. A few personal emails gave us insight into how Hillary celebrates birthdays (mostly with phone calls).  The programing was a simple question and response code.
Having gone through hundreds of emails, it became apparent how asinine the controversy over them actually was.  Having scraped the mass of Clinton’s emails and deciding to portray this narrative has become our political comment on the content of the emails.  There isn’t much to be afraid of in terms of top secret information. The scariest part would be how lame Hillary is at partying.
