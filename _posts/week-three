Privacy and transparency are practically antonyms. Both ideas are right in their own ways, but the controversy over data transparency is much more complex than simply the erasure of private information like “ bank account numbers, social security numbers and sexually explicit images uploaded without the subject’s consent (known as “revenge porn.)”.
This “right to be forgotten” ideology marks the beginning of what might be considered a bigger problem. 
Freedom of speech advocates warn at the risks of becoming a culture of erasure. There is also the problem of each country's relationship to the internet.
Since the internet is a global entity, some nations opinions regarding privacy and transparency might differ from others.
As for me: I don’t care. I am tired of the internet and all of the drama of it. Bringing it back to my first writing for this class, I think that there will be a change. 
A new internet- maybe Tesla will come up with something.  My only opinion on privacy and transparency is --- neither.
I feel it is a duty of all organizations and individuals to keep record of their actions, and that the internet is just a super helpful tool to access this information. 
I see the obvious risks of deleting information, but I think we should just get rid of it all.
