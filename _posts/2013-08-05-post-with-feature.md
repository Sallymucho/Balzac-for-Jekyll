Seth Stephens-Davidowitz dives into Google’s data in his mission to uncover truths about society.
Surveys, questionnaires, and polls have given us perspectives on general trends, and society’s values. 
e points out the inherent need people feel to look good, even in the case where you are an anonymous survey taker. 
This social desirability bias is something I have even participated in - hard to tell why. 
Anonymous surveys can ask very personal, difficult, questions, and being set with the challenge of facing my own truths, putting a number to my decisions and writing them on paper is almost too hard, so I lie a little bit.I would also like to point out the fact that It’s a very different thing researching a question on your accord than it is being asked a question by another entity. The rest of the article was less convincing for me. Trends are cool, but Seth’s quantifying of sexuality trends had a lot of holes in it. He pairs the percentages of people who watch gay porn in both Mississippi and Rhode Island with the number of men that identify as gay, but gay men are not the sole viewers of gay male porn. This point felt like a stretch, but overall it was interesting to read about people seeking their secretive questions.
